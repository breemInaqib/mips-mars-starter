# MIPS Assignment Starter (MARS)  
  
This repository contains a starter structure for a MIPS assembly assignment using [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/) simulator.  
  
## Structure  
- `src/` — source assembly files  
- `include/` — for any included macros or data files  
- `tests/` — test programs and scripts  
  
## Getting Started  
1. Place your MIPS source files inside the `src` directory.  
2. Use the provided `run.sh` script to assemble and run your program with MARS. Ensure that the `Mars.jar` file is available or adjust the script accordingly.  
  
## Running the Program  
```sh  
./run.sh src/main.asm  
```  
  
## Requirements  
- Java (to run the MARS jar)  
- [MARS](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/MARS/) simulator (download separately)  
  
Feel free to expand this repository by adding your own modules in `include`, and tests in `tests`.
